# Build a Private Blockchain Notary Service!

In this project, I'll build a Star Registry service that allows users to claim ownership of their favorite star in the night sky.

I'll connect this web service to Ir own private blockchain, allowing users to notarize ownership of a digital asset, in this case whichever star they choose.

## Select Node.js framework

For the development of the project we used the [Express framework](https://expressjs.com/).


## Getting Started

```
npm install
```

## Run the project

```
npm start
```

## Project endpoints

Several tools are available on the internet to assist with API development and testing. If your having troubles testing your endpoints, try one of the tools listed below:

* Postman is a powerful tool used to test web services. It was developed for sending HTTP requests in a simple and quick way.
* CURL is a command-line tool used to deliver requests supporting a variety of protocols like HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SFTP, and many more.
